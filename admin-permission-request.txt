Subject: Azure AD Permission Request - GitHub Actions Service Principal

Hello,

I need to set up automated deployments for the Neo4j Azure project using GitHub Actions. To do this, I need to create a service principal for authentication.

Current Status:
• Name: Ryan Knight
• Email: ryan.knight@neo4j.com
• User Object ID: a71089ec-01fb-4111-9a41-1d07425368c8
• Subscription: Business Development (47fd4ce5-a912-480e-bb81-95fbd59bb6c5)

What I Need:

1. Azure AD Role Assignment
   Please grant me ONE of these roles in Azure Active Directory:

   Option A (Recommended): Application Developer
   - Minimum permissions needed
   - Can create and manage app registrations
   - Cannot manage other users' apps

   OR

   Option B: Application Administrator
   - Can manage all app registrations
   - More permissions than needed but commonly used

   How to grant this:
   • Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → Roles and administrators
   • Search for "Application Developer" or "Application Administrator"
   • Click the role → Add assignments → Add my user

2. Verify Subscription Access
   Please confirm I have "Contributor" or "Owner" role on subscription:
   "Business Development" (47fd4ce5-a912-480e-bb81-95fbd59bb6c5)

Purpose:
This will allow me to create a service principal named "github-actions-neo4j-deploy"
that GitHub Actions will use to deploy Neo4j resources to Azure automatically.

Security Note:
The service principal will only have "Contributor" access scoped to the
specific subscription, following least-privilege principles.

Please let me know once this is configured, and I can proceed with the setup.

Thank you!
Ryan Knight
